"Until 1807 there was comparatively little interest in [privateering] during the Napoleonic War at any of the ports, for merchants were able to engage in overseas commerce through neutral shipping. This was also a period in which the balance of French economic activity finally shifted from the Altantic ports, whose rise had dominated the 1780’s, to the north east of France"\citep[p. 36]{Crowhurst1989}

Brewer The Sinews of Power (1989) “British aggrandizement was impelled by the powerful forces of commercial capitalism” (Banaji p. 6)


Banji p. 48 « The main East India Companies (English, Dutch, and French) were the most powerful of the joint-stock companies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the competition between them was such that David Hume, in an essay published in 1742, could famously say, “Trade was never esteemed an affair of state till the last century.”150 The head-on clash between the English and the Dutch generated the doctrine that came to be called “jealousy of trade.”151 Toward the end of the eighteenth century Adam Smith agreed with Hume that trade had changed European politics in the seventeenth century. In Wealth of Nations he refers to “mercantile jealousy” which “inflames, and is itself inflamed by the violence of national animosity.”152 State and capital now had a unifying “national” interest in securing or retaining commercial dominance. In “Of the Jealousy of Trade” (1752) Hume wrote “Nothing is more usual, among states which have made some advances in commerce, than. . .  to consider all trading states as their rivals.”153 In the late nineteenth century Gustav von Schmoller expressed this more forcefully. “Commercial competition, even in times nominally of peace, degenerated into a state of undeclared hostility: it plunged nations[…] « it plunged nations into one war after another, and gave all wars a turn in the direction of trade, industry, and colonial gain. . . . ”154 »
