%\begin{abstract}
%The aim of my work is to analyse the impact of conflict on trade of neutral countries, not in nineteenth century, as it has been done so far, but on previous periods. We do so first analysing the specific case of trade between France and Hamburg and then compare it to the general case of all other France trading partners. In addition I do a break down by product and look at the difference in impact on colonial and non-colonial goods. I find a striking difference according to the different goods, with some European merchandises even benefiting from the war. Finally I check for the presence of lagged effects of and prewar effects. I find no clear evidence of either of them but to some extent, we can observe an increase in trade after the conflict rather than a sluggish reprise.

\section{Introduction}

\epigraph{Savez-vous Messieurs ce qu’est une bataille navale ? On se rencontre, on se salue, on se canonne et la mer n’en reste pas moins salée.}{Maurepas, Navy Minister of Louis  \textsc{xv}, 1718-1748}



\maketitle


Is mercantilist warfare effective in its own terms, by crippling trade of defeated powers? Our paper explores the Anglo-French experience during the eighteenth century and contributes to understanding why that was not the case.
\cite{jefferson_letter_1823} famously noticed that European nations « were nations of eternal war». Indeed, from 1700 to 1825, 2 years out of 3 experienced conflict between major European powers \cite{roser_war_2016}. Rivalry between Great-Britain and France was central, so much as the period between 1688 to 1815 was called the « 2nd Hundred Years War » 1688-1815. War has many causes. Yet, especially after the death of Louis XIV, it cannot be denied that mercantile rivalry was an important motivation of Anglo-French wars (\cite{wallerstein_modern_1980, crouzet_guerre_2008}). Each nation was jealous of the other's commercial success. The British believed war was a good way to curtail them. The French partly agreed and were more wary of wars because they did not have much naval success. 
Here is the long list of wars between France and Britain after the death of Louis XIV : War of the Polish Succession (1733-1738) (little naval hostilities), War of the Austrian Succession (1740 (naval hostilities started in 1744)–1748), Seven Years' War (1756–1763), War of American independence (1775 (French involvement started in 1778)–1783), French Revolutionary Wars (1792–1802) and Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815). Yet, all these wars were in vain before the 1790s, as French trade increased up to the British level throughout the eighteenth century (Figure \ref{FrBritTrade}).
Looking at peace-time trends (including land only wars), it is clear that French trade, despite big war shocks, was resilient and was not moved out of its pre-1744 trend (Figure \ref{FrPeaceTrade}). Things changed after 1815.

How come the pre-1792 wars did not have a lasting effect on French trade? This is important to understand the effect of wars in general, the geopolitical history of the eighteenth and nineteenth century and the globalization/deglobalization cycle from the 1490s to the 1840s.

There exists a vast literature focusing on the relationship between trade and war.
A first strand of this literature concentrates on the impact of trade on wars. Within this strand, two major perspectives have emerged: a liberal and a realist one. The first supports a vision of interdependence between trade and war, pointing out that trade promotes peace since it is a better method of expansion than wars. The second opposes this view by claiming that there is no impact of trade on wars, and if any, then it will be a positive impact, as countries will be pushed to move war to maintain trade supremacy.
The second strand of the literature, on the other hand, focuses on the impact of conflicts on trade. The works following this perspective are more homogeneous, and most authors agree to the disruptive effects on trade caused by wars. \cite{levy2004trading} analyse the impact of war on trade with adversary countries using seven dyads between 1870-1992, and they find that, although different across dyads, the general impact of conflict on trade is not particularly strong and mostly only temporary. \cite{blomberg2006much} analyse more specifically the effect of all kind of conflicts, distinguishing between internal and external, and find that peace has a large and positive impact on trade. \cite{anderton2001impact} look at the effect of wars on global trade, and find that when major world power are at war significant pre and post war effects are observed, whereas impact is much smaller for conflicts between minor powers. \cite{martin2008make} construct a theoretical model describing the likelihood of war and test it empirically; they find that likelihood of war is much smaller for countries involved in bilateral trade than for those involved in multilateral. Finally \cite{glick2010collateral} try to quantify the economic impact of the two world wars and claim that conflicts had negative effects on both belligerent and neutral countries with lags up to ten years. Altogether, the papers mentioned above do not always find coherent results, and such results were obtained from data from the last century only. The only exception is \cite{rahman2010fighting} who uses British trade data from eighteen century, but concentrates manly on the impact of naval conflicts on trade. The majority of scholars (apart from \cite{levy2004trading}) also finds long lasting effects of war; they claim commerce took several years before restoring its prewar level.\\
The effect of mercantilists wars on French trade does not fit this pattern. \cite{riley_seven_1986}, who concentrates on the case study of the Seven Years War, observes French trade series and he notices that there were no lags but on the contrary pre and post war loss compensation effects. This widely recognized fact about the effect of eighteenth century wars on French trade has led historians to research extensively the strategies of French merchants to cope with war. Neutral carriers were somewhat protected from British predation on the sea. When necessary, French merchants could even hide their cargo ownership behind a neutral partner. Or they could move to neutral countries and operate from there (\cite{marzagalli_was_2016}). Historians have even reflected that war periods might have been necessary to the functioning of the \textit{Éxclusif Colonial}, i.e. the theoretical monopoly of French merchants on French colonial trade (\cite{lespagnol_mondialisation_1997, morineau_vraie_1997, marzagalli_was_2016}). The argument rests on the large peace time trade imbalances between France and its Northern European clients for colonial goods that could have been balanced by large service income of Northern European merchants during war time as they, as neutrals, provided shipping and various trade services to the French empire. The quality of the available balance of payment data is not good enough to test that hypothesis.\\
The aim of this paper is to extend \cite{riley_seven_1986}’s work by analysing the available French data in the eighteenth century. So far the liteature has analysed the impact on trade of twentieth century wars and generalized the results. We believe that the effect of wars in twentieth century is different from that of other wars throughout history, and related data offer only a partial point of view. Thus, we are convinced that analysing less recent data is crucial to understand the general mechanisms relating trade and conflicts. We focus on the particular case of neutral countries and we look into the product breakdown of trade to observe the difference in impact between goods. We find indeed a general negative impact on trade, but looking at the product breakdown, the effect is much stronger in the case of colonial products, whereas in the case of European products the impact was even positive. In addition, We have also checked for the presence of war lags, as \cite{glick2010collateral} suggest. We find no evidence of war lag in the Hamburg series, nor in the general case. On the contrary, we find a positive and significant coefficient for the two years following the war for all countries (around 40\%) and for Hamburg a particular increase in European goods. Finally, we have tested my series for pre-war effects, as suggested by \cite{riley_seven_1986} but in this case we could not find coherent and significant results.  

\section{Dataset}
\subsection{Origin of the data}
For conducting our analysis we use data from the archives of the French \textit{Bureau de la Balance du Commerce}. This institution was created in 1713, after the Treaty of Utrecht, which followed the Spanish succession war. In this circumstances, the French were positively impressed by the detailed knowledge shown by the British on their trade flows and they also decided to create an institution which would keep track of exports and imports from and to France. Before this, there were already local institutions keeping track of goods going in and out of harbour cities (only in quantity terms) but starting 1716 they started sending their records to the \textit{Bureau}. The \textit{Bureau} would then compute aggregate yearly figures for each \textit{direction} (port) and then send them back to the local chamber of commerce, so that they could add the values. Unfortunately those documents did not survive till our days; we still have some records from local sources but they are quite incomplete. On the other hand, another kind of document survived, which reports the total value of trade for each destination for each year, so at least we have reliable figures on aggregate values. Starting from 1750 the \textit{Object Général} was introduced, which was more complete, and was recording each product from and to each destination for all ports. The \textit{Objet Général} survived in its entirety and this is what I have used for my estimations. For the period preceding 1733, I have estimated the data basing on local sources, as explained in section 3. \\
\subsection{Figures}
For the period between 1733 and 1820, this dataset accounts for 146,963 observations, with incomplete data between 1761 and 1767 and missing data between 1782 and 1787, in 1789 and in 1797. There are overall 82 different destinations recorded, but each one of them is not present every year. Rather than single countries they are groups of countries and most destinations get broken down into smaller destinations in later periods or even disappeared to be replaced by other smaller entities. To bypass this problem I used country grouping. Eleven different groups could be created and each of them comprises all the evolution of one destination, so that I can have observations for each group for each year. The groups I am considering are: Germany, England, Flanders and Habsburg Monarchy, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Colonies, Dutch Republic, India, Levant, North. \\
Values in the dataset are always expressed in \textit{livres turnois}, but I will convert them in grams of fine silver to have a comparable estimate year to year. The value of the \textit{livre} has been constant at 4.505 grams of fine silver all throughout the period in consideration.

\subsection{Limitation and Missing data}
As mentioned above, for the whole period preceding 1749, the only available data we have from the French source is either the yearly aggregate figures by destination, or the incomplete local sources, which on the other hand contains information on each product. For this reason, in order to perform the comparison between the two datasets and the subsequent analysis, it will be necessary to estimate the full value of exports from the available data. In order to do this, we run the following regression:
\begin{center}
$\ln(product_{i,j,k,t})=\beta_0 + \beta_1year_t+\beta_3direction_k$
\end{center}
where the dependent variable products stands for the value of exports of one product, for each port reported in the local source and for each year. Year is a set of year dummies and direction is also a set of dummies that indicates in which port the data were recorded (direction also includes "France", meaning all ports). This model aims at predicting the export value of single products per year basing on the yearly changes in export and on the export composition by source, with the assumption that the composition is constant overtime. We run the model on the whole available years but we only do so for coffee, sugar, wine, eau vie and an aggregate category of all other goods (other). In addition, to avoid the problem of log of zero trade flows, we have substituted them with 0.001, so that observations would not drop but the zero flows in the estimation could be taken into account as a value really close to zero. Finally, we also added weights on value, as to give more importance to flows higher in value. The results are pretty satisfactory, in fact the pattern of estimated and actual value are very similar. 


\section{Historical context}
\subsection{War of Polish Succession}
The war of Polish succession took place between 1733 and 1738. It started with the death of the king of Poland August Iwe who died heirless and soon become a conflict at European level. France, Prussia and Spain were trying to limit the desire of expansion of the Habsburg monarchy, which was aiming at extend its power over Poland. The lack of support by England however, concluded the war in 1738, with the recognition of August IIwe as king of Poland. The belligerent countries were France, Spain and Italy on the one side and the Habsburg Monarchy on the other. 

\subsection{War of Austrian Succession}
The war of Austrian succession was a European conflict that burst in 1740 over the eligibility to succession to the crown of Maria Theresa of Austria, as the heir of the Habsburg Monarchy after the death of her father. It started out as a European conflict but after 1744 it involved also the colonies. Belligerent countries were France, Spain, Prussia and Italy on one side and England, Habsburg monarchy and the Dutch Republic on the other. 

\subsection{Seven Years Wars}
The Seven year war was a major conflict, which took place between 1756 and 1763. It is consider the first real world conflict and European powers were fighting over possession of colonies. Belligerents countries were: England, Prussia and Portugal on one side and France, Spain, Habsburg monarchy, and Dutch Republic on the other. 

\subsection{American Revolutionary War}
The American Revolutionary War took place between 1778 and 1782. In this case the field of battle was not Europe anymore, but directly the Colonies. British North American colonies were rebelling against Britain control over their trade and were fighting for independence. Belligerent countries were England on the one side and France, Spain and British Colonies on the other (later United States). During this war the First League of Armed Neutrality was signed between Russia, Sweden and Denmark. Spain accepted this agreement however Britain demurred. When Dutch Republic was about to join this league, Britain found out before the treaty was signed and captured a Dutch ships, thus forcing the Dutch to enter war against them. Starting 1781 therefore, the Dutch Republic also became a belligerent country, allied to France. 

\subsection{French Revolutionary Wars}
The French Revolutionary Wars took place between 1792 and 1802. It was a conflict that had started as a consequence of French Revolution, in 1789, with the hope of spreading the revolutionary ideas around Europe. During this war, France and Spain were fighting against most of the rest of Europe, in particular Great Britain and the Hasburg Monarchy. France experienced an unexpected success in continental Europe, because of the raise in power of general Napoloen Bonaparte, however was on the other hand heavily defeated by the Royal Navy, thus loosing supremacy over the Mediterranean and also its colonies. This conflict was ended by the Treaty of Amiens in 1802, which started the only year of peace in Europe between 1792 and 1815.

\subsection{Napoleonic Wars}
The Napoleonic wars were a series of conflict between the French Empire of Napoleon we and  other countries, primarily led by the British, which took place in the years 1803 to 1815. Its consequences were the final defeat of Napoleon, and the First French Empire, and the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power. On the other hand, this conflict contributed to spread all over Europe the nationalist and liberal ideas that were born during the French Revolution, despite the restoration of the monarchy in France and the decay of the Revolutionary principles. 

%\section{Analysis of impact of conflict on Hamburg trade}
%As a first step we have constructed a Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood model with the value of exports flows towards Hamburg as a dependent variable and introducing a war dummy to capture the effect of wars. We did so first using only one dummy for all wars and then adding one dummy for each war. 
%\begin{equation}
%exports_t=\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1year+\beta_3war)
%\end{equation}
%\begin{multline}
%exports_t=\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1year+\beta_3polish +\beta_4austrian1 +\beta_5 austrian2+ \\ + \beta_5seven + \beta_6american +\beta_7revolutionary+\beta_8napoleonic)
%\end{multline}
%
%where $exports$  is the value of exports per year and  $year$ is the time trend. We are using time trend rather than year fixed effects for the scarcity of data and because time fixed effects would be collinear with the war dummy otherwise.
%In the war by war case, we have considered the Austrian Succession war as two different conflicts as to try to capture the difference between the colonial and non colonial phase.\\
%From the first equation we find that wars overall had a negative impact on Hamburg trade, amounting to a fall of roughly 42\%. By breaking down the effect for each single war, we find a 78\% reduction in trade caused by the Polish war, a decrease of 56\% for the first part of the Austrian war and a decrease of 62\%, 69\%, 18\%, 11\% and 19\% for the second part of Austrian war, Seven year war, American Revolutionary war, French Revolutionary war and Napoleonic war respectively, with the latter three coefficients not significant. These results are quite striking and incoherent with the series observed above: the effect of the Polish war in fact are barely visible in the trend, even though our regression suggests they are the stronger ones, whereas the effects of the Seven Years War are not that disruptive, as one would expect. There are two possible explanations to this fact. The first is that the data for the period 1733 to 1750 are not very reliable, as they come from local sources which are incomplete, and they are only estimates of what the true value might have been, as explained in section 3. The second explanation is that in 1795, as a consequence of the Revolutionary Wars, France had lost Saint Domingue, which had proclaimed its independence from France and together with it, its main sources of export to the North: sugar and coffee. Therefore, what we observe after this date, is an incisive break in the trend of exports and, as a consequence, a decline in total trade towards Hamburg. To take into account this effect, we have run a Chow test, by adding to the previous regressions a break both in time trend and in fixed effects. This test shows that there is indeed a break in 1795 and after introducing it in the model, the effects of the different wars become more coherent with respect to the series plotted above. The effect of Polish war goes down to -8\% and the coefficient is insignificant whereas Seven Years War and revolutionary War result as the most disruptive ones, with a loss in trade of 62\% and 73\% respectively. 
%
%\input{hamburg1_reg}
%
%We also perform two different robustness checks for these results, using a log-linear model, (section 7) but they do not change significantly the coefficients of the regression. \\
%On average we can say that wars were very disruptive for Hamburg trade, despite it being a neutral country, which does reflect what claimed by Glick and Taylor (2005), concerning effects of war even on neutral countries. One remark should be added however; wars in the first half of eighteenth century (until 1744, separation suggested by Carrière 1973), which were mostly non-colonial, had a smaller impact on Hamburg trade. This is a first interesting result, in the sense that, we see here that not all wars had the same effects; more specifically wars fought in Europe had smaller effects than wars fought also/only in the colonies. In our opinion an explanation has to be found in the fact that the major source of import for Hamburg was actually colonial products, the trade of which during colonial wars was interrupted. On the other, We believe that the trade of European products did not have such a strong interruption and that it might even be the case that given the impossibility to trade exotic products, the commerce of other goods might have developed more to compensate for losses. \\
%To test this hypothesis, we have looked at exports flows disaggregated by products. We only consider the main two colonial products (sugar and coffee) and the main two European products (wine and eau de vie) plus one category (other), encompassing all the remaining 35 different goods. We run the following regression, interacting the product dummies with the war dummies, first with all wars in one dummy and then separately:
%\begin{equation}
%exports_i=\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1year+ 
%\beta_2product_i + \beta_3product_iyear+\beta_4product_iwar)
%\end{equation}
%\begin{multline}
%exports_i=\exp(\beta_0+beta_1year+\beta_2product_i + \beta_3product_iyear+\beta_4product_ipolish + \\ +\beta_4product_iaustrian1 + \beta_5product_iaustrian2 + \beta_6product_iseven +\beta_7product_iamerican+  \\ +\beta_8product_irevolutionary+\beta_8product_inapoleonic)
%\end{multline}
%
%where$year$ is again the time trend, $product_i$ is product fixed effect, $product_iyear$ is the product time trend and $product_iwar$ is the interaction of the product dummy with the war dummy, which is the coefficient of interest. As we mentioned before, it is reasonable to assume a break in 1795, and in this case, we can insert it for the products specifically concerned, i.e. sugar and coffee. Once more, both the time trend and the fixed effects Chow test are significant and they yield more sensible estimates. Table 19 shows the results of the regression with no break, with one break only for coffee and with breaks for both sugar and coffee. \\
%The impact of conflicts in general on colonial products was significantly greater, -76\% for coffee and -68\% on sugar, whereas the impact on wine is definitely smaller and insignificant and exports of eau de vie is even positive and very big in size (+7\% and +300\% respectively).
%Given these first results, we can indeed say that the disruption in trade was led by the collapse of colonial products, but some European products, on the other hand, were even benefiting from conflicts. It is in fact evident from the graph shown below that to the collapse of sugar and coffee 1795 there is a corresponding peak in the export of wine and eau de vie.\\~\\
%%\caption{\textbf{Inverse trends of European and Colonial products}}
%\includegraphics[scale=.35]{hamburg_product_1780.png}
%\includegraphics[scale=.35]{hamburg_product_1820.png}\\~\\
%Turning to the war by war case, results are less well-defined. The impact of each war is indeed negative but not necessarily sugar and coffee are more impacted than wine and eau de vie and we are no more able to disentangle the effects of colonial and non-colonial conflicts that precisely. Adding the break for coffee and sugar does not change the picture too much, and in this instance only the Chow test for coffee is significant. Nonetheless, it is interesting to notice that, when considering only the break for coffee, on average, wine and eau de vie are more strongly impacted during Polish and Austrian war, whereas sugar and coffee show a bigger decrease during the Seven Years war and the subsequent wars. We can therefore state, that also in this case, even in a less clearcut way, we can observe the difference in impact depending on the kind of wars. As for the aggregate case, the size of the coefficient for the wars preceding 1750, might be biased by the inaccuracy of our estimation and the incompleteness of data, which is not corrected for by adding a break, in this case. 
%An interesting point to remark is that, by looking at the wine time series in section 4, we also notice an interesting pattern during Seven Years War, increasing initially and then decreasing during the second half of the conflict.  We will not analyse this issue more in detail here but it could be the object of further research. 
%\input{hamburg2_all_reg}
%\input{hamburg2_each_reg}
%In sum, from the estimations made so far, we can conclude that there was indeed an overall negative impact on Hamburg trade, but it was very product specific, with colonial products suffering more than others and European products benefiting from the conflict on the other hand.
%
%\subsection{War lags}
%****\textbf{Should I keep this part?}\\
%The impact on European products was found strongly negative for European wars but not that significant in Colonial wars. These results are already in contrast with some of the literature (i. e. Glick and Taylor (2005) and Thierry, Martin and Mayer (2010)), which found generic negative impact on trade with no war-type or product-type differentiation. Only Blomberg and Hess (2004), have disentangled the impact of different kind of conflicts but they focused on external versus internal violence instead.\\
%Another interesting issue which is extensively treated in the literature is the presence of war lags and slow trade recovery after conflicts. Glick and Taylor (2005) for instance, found major war lags for both neutral and adversary countries for a period up to ten years. We have tested their findings on our Hamburg series, adding to the above regressions dummies for lag from 1 to 5 years (tables are the appendix). We have opted for 5 years of lag because in this period trade was much more unstable and effects after five years might have been due to other unrelated issues. In addition, using 10 years lags would basically mean including another war period. For this same reason we are only looking at lags for the Austrian Succession war, Seven Years War and Napoleonic wars, and those three wars together (no data are available for the period immediately after American Revolutionary War). We have done so again on all wars together and on wars separately as before. Results are not very coherent across regressions. In the overall case, coefficients of lag dummies are negative, with the first and third year of lag being insignificant and smaller in size. Splitting the one war dummy into the five different wars, lags are alternating signs for the Austrian War and Seven Years War, starting with positive, but are constantly negative and significant for the Napoleonic War.
%Turning to the breakdown by product, on the other hand, we notice that there is evidence of strong war lags for all products, interestingly enough, for eau de vie as well, which, during conflicts had experienced a strong increase. This might suggest that wars were boosting trade of certain products in the period of the conflict, which were then restoring their prewar trade level, after the conflict had stopped.\\
%Overall we can say that we do not have a clear picture on the existence of war lags: there is evidence of some post-conflicts effect, however they are not always negative, significant or long lasting, as described in the literature. \\
%\iffalse
%This was also noted by \cite{riley_seven_1986}, who analyses the case of the Seven Years War and claims that merchants were actually forecasting the wars (using price of lead) and stocking products to sell them at the end of the conflict, thus compensating for war losses. He also claims that this was not only happening after the wars but also before, so he saw an increase in exports before and after wars. we have tested his findings on my data by adding to the main regression a dummy for up to four years preceeding the conflict, as suggested by \cite{riley_seven_1986}. In the general case (all wars in one dummy) coefficient are positive but very small, so Riley’s claim is not really reflected here. On the other hand, in the war-by-war case, coefficients for one year preceding conflict are positive and bigger in size, however it is not a constant effect throughout the four years. 
%we have then run the same regressions by adding product fixed effects, as before, and introducing pre-war dummies interacted with products. Results do not differ much from the aggregate level; there is a constant positive effect one year before the war, which in this case it is more pronounced for European goods. In the war-by-war case finally, there is no big change with the results of the other regressions. \\
%In short, we have found no evidence of war lags or loss in trade subsequent to the war, it looks more like trade increased after the war (all coefficient are positive) and even if it does not exactly overshoot, at least it recovered extremely fast its pre-war level and growth rate. 
%\fi
%In this section we have made four main points on the impact of war on Hamburg; 1) war is indeed a major source of trade disruption, 2) the impact however was mainly on colonial goods such as sugar and coffee, 3) there is no evidence of war lags but on the contrary trade increased following the conflict 4) It was not possible to disentangle precisely the effect of colonial versus non colonial wars. In next section we compare these findings with the case of overall exports of France towards all countries. \\

\section{Empirical Analysis}
In this section we have compared the results obtained for Hamburg with the general case of all French trading partners in eighteenth century. We have run a difference in difference specification to see the difference in impact for neutral and adversary countries with respect to allies. As in the case of Hamburg, we have again incomplete data on products preceding 1750, so We have estimated the value for sugar coffee, wine and eau de vie through the same technique. \\
We started my analysis running the following equation for all wars together and separately:
\begin{equation}
exports_{i,t}=\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1year + \beta_2country_i+\beta_3country_iyear+\beta_4adversaries_i+\beta_5neutral_i)
\end{equation}

where $year$ is year time trend, $country$ is country fixed effects, $country_iyear$ is country time trends, $adversaries$ is a dummy variable that takes value 1 if a country is adversary to France during a conflict and $neutral$ is again a dummy indicating whether a country was neutral (rather than adversary or allied). Even in this case we did not have enough data to estimate country year fixed effects so we have used time trend.\\
From the first regression we can see that war had on average a negative impact on trade of neutral countries of around 31\%. As for the case of Hamburg, we have run a Chow test for the year 1795, first for all countries and then for those countries importing mainly colonial goods. The test is significant for all countries and the result do not change much from one specification to the other. 
By looking at each single war separately, we notice that the difference in impact between colonial and non colonial wars is not really evident anymore, even after inserting the 1795 break. The first three wars, Polish Austrian 1 and 2, seem to have the biggest impact, whereas the subsequent colonial wars have a minor effect. As mentioned before, we suspect that this is due to imprecisions in the data. \\
Overall the impact for all wars is indeed negative and this finding is line with Hamburg case, discussed previously. However, loss estimated for neutral countries are less striking than the ones found for Hamburg and in particular, they are distributed differently  in the war by war case.
For this reason we have looked again into the breakdown by the major products and analysed the impact of wars on different goods. we am arguing that in eighteenth century wars did not have an impact on all goods evenly, but rather on some specific goods. Hamburg's imports from France were mainly made up of colonial products, which were more vulnerable to conflicts, and this explains why its losses were so huge. On the other hand, this was not the case for other countries, whose import composition was totally different and which probably suffered to a lesser extent. Different destinations had really different patterns of exports, and it would be interesting to see whether groups of nations suffered more according to their import composition than their belligerent/neutral status. 
In this setting, however, we am only considering the four main goods analysed in the Hamburg case, as to be able to perform a comparison.\\
More than an impact on all trade, we believe it was a matter of impact on trade of certain products. \\
In line with this reasoning, we run again a regression with a product breakdown and analyse the impact of all conflicts together and war by war:
\begin{multline}
exports_{i,t}=\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1year +\beta_2country_i+\beta_3country_iyear+\beta_4product_{i,j}+\beta_5product_jyear+\\+\beta_6product_jadversary + \beta_7product_jneutral)
\end{multline}
where $country_iproduct_j$ is country product fixed effects, $country_iyear$ and $product_jyear$ are country and product time trend and $product_jadversary$ and $product_jneutral$ are adversaries and neutral dummies interacted with product dummies. This regression relies on the assumption that product fixed effects are country-specific whereas product time trend do not differ across countries. we have also run a specification where we relax this assumption and we assumes both country products fixed effects and country products specific trends, but the difference is not noticeable (section 7).

\input{allcountry2_all_reg.tex}
\input{allcountry2_each_reg.tex}

The results on all wars are definitely in line with the Hamburg case. Overall the impact on coffee and sugar is strongly negative and significant (-70\% and -66\%) whereas only a small and insignificant impact can be found on wine (+6\%) and a strongly positive one can be see on eau de vie (+160\%). These figures are now much closer to those found for Hamburg and the breakdown by product seems to be explaining it pretty well. Looking at the regression where we consider each war separately, on the other hand, results are again less coherent. Colonial goods always experience a decrease during war period, however, there is no evidence of greater impact during colonial wars, or smaller impact during European wars. It is interesting to notice, however, that, starting from Seven Years Wars we find again the same pattern as in the one dummy case, i.e. sugar and coffee are always strongly negative and significant whereas wine and eau de vie are positive and mostly insignificant. This is again in line with the Hamburg case and actually suggests that during the war there could have a been some sort of substitution effect (on the offer side rather than on the demand side), which was pushing merchants to trade more “safer” goods and make up for war looses.\\
\iffalse
\subsection{War lags}
In line with this reasoning, we turned next to analyse and compare war lags in the Hamburg case and general case. we run two regressions with and without product differentiation and for all wars together and a dummy for each war: 
\begin{multline}
\ln(exports_{i,t})=\beta_0+\beta_1country_i+\beta_2country_iyear+\beta_3adversaries_i+\beta_4neutral_i+\\+\beta_5adversary_ilag+\beta_6neutral_ilag+\beta_8allies_ilag
\end{multline}
\begin{multline}
\ln(exports_{i,t})=\beta_0+\beta_1country_i+\beta_2country_iyear+\beta_3product_{i,j}+\beta_4product_jyear+\\+\beta_5product_jadversary+ \beta_6product_jneutral+\beta_7product_jadversary_ilag+\beta_8neutral_ilag+\beta_9allies_ilag
\end{multline}

Results are quite in line with those seen in the Hamburg series. There is no post war negative coefficient, but on the contrary, trade increases by 40\% and 47\% in the first and second year after the war. Starting from the third year this effect decreases and coefficients are still positive but smaller. \\
Product-wise there is evidence of positive post war effects for all the products but in particular European products increase stably for the first four years after the war. War by war, we notice an interesting pattern after Seven Years War; exports of European goods increases as for the general case, but here we see that trade of sugar as well expands right after the war (+62\%). This is quite an interesting result given that sugar was, with coffee, the product which suffered the most during this conflict. 
In sum, we can say that, as for the case of Hamburg, there is no clear evidence of war lags, for sure not 10 years lag as claimed by Glick and Taylor (2005). Trade was extremely adaptive to conflicts in eighteenth century and neutral countries did not seem to suffer strong consequences.
we have also run the regression checking for pre war effects. Results are positive but very small in size for the general case, except for the case of allies countries, which has larger and more significant coefficients. The war-by-war case (considered all in one regression) is also not very meaningful; coefficients for Seven Years War are negative whereas those for American Revolutionary War are positive. In terms of difference between products, the results are again not very interesting. There is no stable pattern for pre war effect, except for coffee, which always shows an increase for all the four years preceding the war. However this might be just due to the increasing trend shown by coffee, disregarding the effects of wars.
Overall, for neutral countries the compensation effect is more likely as a post war phenomenon rather than a pre war one, again as noted for the case of Hamburg.

\section{Robustness check}
We have also run some robustness check both for the Hamburg case and the general case. We have done so by using a log linear specification specification instead of the poisson pseudo maximum likelihood. \\
We have re-run all regressions mentioned in section 4 and 5, so both for Hamburg only and for all export destinations together. In the Hamburg aggregate case, the effects of wars are still negative and it is still possible to distinguish between colonial and non-colonial conflicts. While looking at the breakdown by products despite the fact that there is still a strong impact for colonial goods, no significant impact is found for wine and eau de vie, whose coefficients are negative and positively respectively, but insignificant. In the all-countries case on the other hand, the picture remains quite unchanged, and while the effect on coffee and sugar is strongly negative and significant, the effect on eau de vie is again positive and significant, even though less high, and wine is negative but small and insignificant. When turning to the aggregate case, results are very robust to the different specification and the effects are, once more, quite similar to the baseline case. \\
In addition to this, given the limited number of observations available in the Hamburg series at aggregate level, we have re-run the regression on the disaggregate export value by product, by adding product fixed effects to the regressions, but without interacting them with the war dummies. Table is shown in the appendix. The results of this different specification change a bit the picture in terms of colonial and non colonial wars, with non colonial wars resulting more disruptive that the colonial ones. The effect of the Polish war is also greater and that of the Seven years war is smaller.\\
Finally, as we have mentioned before, for the all-countries case with the product breakdown, we have relaxed the assumption of product time trend across countries and run a regression with country-product time trend. In both cases, the results are extremely close. In the regression with one dummy for all wars, coffee and sugar are nearly unchanged, only eau de vie and wine are a bit less positive. In the war-by-war case, results stay approximately the same, with the first three wars with a generalised strong effect and the last four with alternate effects on the different products. All tables are to be found in the appendix in the appendix.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we have analysed the effects of conflicts on neutral countries, taking Hamburg as a case study, and then compared our findings with the general case of all countries together. At aggregate yearly level, the impact of conflict on trade found for Hamburg looks much higher than the general case. To inspect this phenomenon, we then broke down the value of the series in four different products plus one category encompassing all other goods, and we checked for the impact on those specific products. We found that the difference between products is quite striking; colonial products suffer a bust in trade but trade of some European product even increased during conflicts. We have also checked for the difference in effects according to each kind of war, and in the case of Hamburg there is indeed evidence of a stronger effect of colonial wars on colonial products and of European wars on non-colonial products. This pattern however is not evident in the general case and we could not really disentangle the effects of the different kind of wars in a clear way. The results on the single products however, are robust to different specifications and it is indeed the case that some goods experienced a trade expansion in correspondence to conflicts and the collapse of other products. \\
We have also validated our results with several robustness check, including different Poisson Maximum Likelihood and log-linear specification but our findings do not change significantly. It would be interesting to aggregate countries to according to their export composition rather than their belligerent status and see whether our findings are still valid, but we leave this to further research. 
In conclusion, we are pointing out the fact that our results are quite different from those found in the literature so far, because we are using an example from another historical period. Most scholars treating this subject have used twentieth century data and generalized their findings to the overall history, disregarding the fact that twentieth century had brought major variations in many aspects. Wars had changed dramatically and their disruptive power had increased incredibly in the contemporary period. For this reason, results found in the literature so far are not robust to an extension over a longer time span, and with our contribution we intend to fill this gap. We believe that this work, by increasing the variety of the landscape of the observed effects of wars, might help to shed more light on the general mechanisms that link conflicts and commerce.
