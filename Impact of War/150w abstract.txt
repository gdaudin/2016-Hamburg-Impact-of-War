Was mercantilist warfare eﬀective in its own terms, by crippling trade of defeated powers? Our paper explores the Anglo-French experience during the eighteenth century and contributes to understanding why that was not the case. Using new French data by product and by partner, we explore the general mechanisms relating trade and conﬂicts. We look into the product breakdown of trade to observe the diﬀerence in impact between goods. We ﬁnd indeed a general negative impact on trade, but looking at the product breakdown, the eﬀect is much stronger in the case of colonial products, whereas in the case of European products the impact was even positive. The post-war recovery of French trade is very quick. It took the Wars of the Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars to actually cripple French trade.
