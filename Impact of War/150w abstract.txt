The futility of mercantilist wars : a case study of France between 1733 and 1820

Was Mercantilist warfare effective in its own terms, by crippling trade of defeated powers? Our paper explores the Anglo-French experience during the eighteenth century and contributes to understanding why that was not the case. Using new French data by product and by partner, we explore the general mechanisms relating trade and conflicts. We look into the product breakdown of trade to observe the difference in impact between goods. We find indeed a general negative impact on trade, but looking at the product breakdown, the effect is much stronger in the case of colonial products, whereas in the case of European products the impact was even positive. The post-war recovery of French trade is very quick. It took the Wars of the Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars and the Continental Blockade to actually change the trajectory of French trade.
